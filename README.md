# Open Hospital - UI

[![CI build](https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-ui/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/informatici/openhospital-ui/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This is the UI component of [Open Hospital][openhospital]: it contains a web user interface that consists of a React SPA (single page application).
This project depends on the [API component][openhospital-api] that exposes business logic APIs implemented in the [Core component][openhospital-core].  
_This project is still in early stages. For a more mature user interface of Open Hospital, check out the [GUI project][openhospital-gui]._

## How to build

This project is based on React. To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).  
To install the project dependencies, issue:

    - npm i

**It has to be done before any of the following activities**

## How to publish on Github Pages

    - npm run build:gh-pages
    - git commit

    then

    - git subtree push --prefix build intesys-oh gh-pages

    or

    - git subtree split --prefix build develop
    - git push intesys-oh GIT_ID:gh-pages --force

## How to deploy backend in docker environment

Make sure you have docker with docker-compose installed, then run the following commands:

    - cd docker/
    - DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker-compose build [--no-cache]
    - docker-compose up
    - docker-compose  exec database /bin/bash
    - cd sql/
    - mysql -u isf -p
    - source create_all_demo.sql;

When done successfully, head over at http://localhost:[API_PORT]/oh-api/swagger-ui.html

You can change the deployment branch and the repository organization in the docker/.env file.

## How to launch the application

You can run a development build of the application by issuing:

    - npm start

## How to run unit tests

To run unit tests, issue:

    - npm test

## How to launch the e2e tests

Run:

    - npm run e2e

it launches application in development mode and starts cypress, in a single process.

---

If you want more control over **Cypress e2e tests**, use two different processes: one for serving the app (**process #1**) and one for running the Cypress Test Runner (**process #2**). You can launch it by issuing the following commands in two different intances of your terminal:

    //process #1
    - npm start

    //process #2
    - npm run cypress:open

Once the app is compiled and served, and the Cypress Test Runner is launched, click on _Run all specs_
